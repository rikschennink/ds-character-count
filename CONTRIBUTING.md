# Contribution guidelines

We really like contributions and bug reports, but we do have a few guidelines to bear in mind.

## Raising bugs

When raising bugs please explain the issue in good detail and provide a guide to how to replicate it.
When describing the bug it's useful to follow the format:

- what you did
- what you expected to happen
- what happened

## Suggesting features

Please raise feature requests as issues before contributing any code.

This ensures they are discussed properly before any time is spent on them.

## Contributing code

### Coding standards

Please refer to [govuk-frontend coding standars](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/coding-standards/index.md):
- [CSS](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/coding-standards/css.md)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/coding-standards/js.md)

### Indentation and whitespace

Your JavaScript code should pass [linting](docs/linting.md). Maintain 2-space, soft-tabs only indentation. No trailing whitespace.

### Commit hygiene

Please see our [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.
